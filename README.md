# Chess-history
For this project, I am reviewing my own history of games played on Chess.com.  During Covid I started playing chess, and since then I have played over 6,000 games online.  I am interested in pursuing a chess title, and this project means to explore all of my games data to see how quickly I am improving, what areas of my game are the weakest, and how I can become a more rounded player.

## Data
All of my games data was gathered from the chess.com api at https://api.chess.com/pub/player/Spicy_Chris

## Config
To view this project, download game_analysis.ipynb and run it in jupyter notebook.  No data needs to be downloaded

## Future
Moving forward, I am going to analyse the quality of each move with Stockfish.  This will take several hours.  I will create an SQL database to store the results so future iterations do not need to recalculate all moves.  Then, I will track how often I move each piece, which tiles each of my pieces is on the most often, and track how often I make a mistake with each piece type.
